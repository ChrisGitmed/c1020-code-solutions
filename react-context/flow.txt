1. User can sign up

When the user enters their info and clicks the register button,
an event listener on the button (handleSubmit) sends a POST
request to the server.

The server then checks to make sure there is a valid username
and password included in the body of the request. If so, it
hashes the password using argon2.

The database is then queried to insert a new user using the
hashed password and username.

If all this succeeds, the handleSubmit method completes by changing the
window location hash to ‘sign-in’ and swapping the view.



2. User can sign in

When the user enters their info and clicks sign in, An event listener on
the button (handleSubmit) sends a POST request to the server.
The server then checks to make sure that both a username and
Password were entered.

If so, the database is queried for the userId and hashedPassword
of the user with the entered username.

If a matching username is found, the verify method of argon2 checks
the entered password against the hashed password. If the passwords
match, a JSON web token is given to the user, containing their userId,
username, and a secret token used by the server to identify them.

If all this succeeds, the resulting object containing the token and
payload are passed back to the client as a prop.

Then the render method is called to change and changes the view to the
home page.


User can stay signed in

After signing in once, a token produced by the server and identifying the client,
is saved to local storage, and the username is saved to state. When the page
loads (mounts), if the correct token is found in local storage, the user will be
authorized and the user's home page is rendered.
This will persist until they click the sign out button, which will remove the
token from storage and force the user to sign in again if they want another one.
