1. User can sign up

When the user enters their info and clicks the register button,
An event listener on the button (handleSubmit) sends a POST
Request to the server.

The server then checks to make sure there is a valid username
And password included in the body of the request. If so, it
hashes the password using argon2.

The database is then queried to insert a new user using the
hashed password and username.

If all this succeeds, the handleSubmit method completes by changing the window
Location hash to ‘sign-in’ and swapping the view.



2. User can sign in

When the user enters their info and clicks sign in, An event listener on
the button (handleSubmit) sends a POST request to the server.
The server then checks to make sure that both a username and
Password were entered.

If so, the database is queried for the userId and hashedPassword
of the user with the entered username.

If a matching username is found, the verify method of argon2 checks
the entered password against the hashed password. If the passwords
Match, a JSON web token is given to the user, containing their userId,
Username, and a secret token used by the server to identify them.

If all this succeeds, the resulting object containing the token and payload
Are passed back to the client as a prop.

Then the render method is called to change and changes the view to the
home page.


User can stay signed in

After a client signs in once, and as long as they don’t sign out,
the token they recieve from the first sign-in will be added to the
request headers when they visit the page. This causes the home view
to render instead of the login or signup view.
